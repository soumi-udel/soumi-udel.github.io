This site contains:
* Papers
* Answers
* Productivity tips

**Papers** refer to articles that I enjoyed reading. They will probably come with some commentary. **Answers** are answers (duh) to questions that I have been asked multiple times, usually pertaining to academia, grad school, admissions, etc. **Productivity tips** contains stuff that helped me work harder, better, faster, stronger.

The reason for my blog is given in the last paragraph in [this blog post](http://matt.might.net/articles/successful-phd-students/) written by [this computer science professor](http://matt.might.net/#personal). His full blog is [here](http://matt.might.net/).
