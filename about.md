I'm a chemical engineer pursuing my PhD at the University of Delaware.

From time to time, I come across a paper that I think more people should read, especially chemical engineering undergraduates. This blog will contain such papers.

From time to time, I get asked the same questions again. This blog contains answers to questions I've been asked repeatedly. 

From time to time, I get the urge to share a productivity tip, a fun thing you can do at grad school, a way to keep morale high, or such. This blog contains some of these suggestions.
