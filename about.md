This site contains:
* Papers
* Answers
* Tips

**Papers** refer to articles that I enjoyed reading. When I'm asked the same question more than a couple of times, I write down my response in the **Answers** section. **Tips** contain stuff that helped me make my life easier.

The reason for my blog is given in the last paragraph in [this blog post](http://matt.might.net/articles/successful-phd-students/) written by [this computer science professor](http://matt.might.net/#personal). His full blog is [here](http://matt.might.net/).
