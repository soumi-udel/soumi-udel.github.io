## Motivation

In a recent ICT Alumni meeting over Zoom, we figured it would be useful to talk about our research and make the conversations available to chemical engineering and technology undergraduates. 

It is tricky for undergraduates to figure out what the latest developments in the field are, what projects they might enjoy, and what a given research lab looks like. Out-of-date lab websites, and shifting research interests add to the difficulty.

The people best placed to deliver latest information, and discuss what the state of the art is, are ICT Alumni who have just finished or are about to finish their PhD. And there are plenty of alumni, working across the world, in a range of areas - from biotherapeutics to process control. 

This is an effort to bridge the gap between the two groups. The plan is to have quick, fun and interesting conversations - in podcast form - on all the diverse stuff that constitutes the latest in chemical engineering.

## How you can contribute

#### Talk about your research.
If you have recently finished or are about to finish your PhD, why don't you sit down with me and have a conversation about it? What kind of projects does your lab work on? How do they relate? How does _your_ project relate? 

#### Talk to others about their research.
Do you like listening more than talking? Can you coax others to talk about their work? If you have a decent internet connection and microphone, you can carry out these discussions yourselfl

#### Audio engineering
