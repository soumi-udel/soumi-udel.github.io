title: Kisses of Death in Grad School Statements of Purpose

---

<hr>

['Kisses of Death in the Graduate School Application Process'](https://psychology.unl.edu/psichi/Graduate_School_Application_Kisses_of_Death.pdf) is a fantastic resource for writing Statements of Purpose. Backed by data and straight from the horses' mouth, this pdf is a great read for anyone applying to graduate school. 

>A survey of psychology graduate admissions committee chairs revealed 5 categories of mistakes applicants make that diminish their probability of acceptance. 

While the document discusses all elements of the application process, I believe it will be most useful for writing your Statement of Purpose/ Personal Statement.
