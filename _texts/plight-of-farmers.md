The state government has been pushing solar photovoltaics (solar PV) very hard in many ways, one being solar PV pumps for farmers instead of a grid connection. In the past farmers were able to get a connection for a subsidized rate of five to seven thousand even though it cost MSEDCL[^fn1] one lakh rupees for each connection on an average. The rest came from either special funds for SC/ST farmers, from the District Planning and Development Council, or from MSEDCL’s schemes like Infra I and Infra II. But since the last one year, the government and MSEDCL has made a change to that. The farmers can now apply either for a special type of grid connection called HVDS (High Voltage Distribution System or _Ucch Veej Daab Pranali_), but no longer the ordinary type of connection.

HVDS costs much more than the common grid connection and can go up to more than two and half times the ordinary connection. The exact cost of any electricity connection for a farmer depends on the location of the pump in relation to the current electric lines in the area. When a new connection is to be given out, a survey is done by a lineman and engineer determines the cost based on the survey. If the engineer finds that the HVDS connection is to cost more than 2.5 lakhs, MSEDCL lets the farmer know that he has to pay the additional cost, or wait for some scheme to come up in the future, or apply for a solar pump.

So why is MSEDCL adopting HVDS? In the HVDS system, a special transformer is set up close to the farmer’s pump, and only 2 farmers have a connection to each transformer. Due to this, farmers receive better voltage hence preventing pump failures and pump stoppage. A cheaper solution is to have only 15 farmers on each transformer in the ordinary grid system instead of the 25 or more that MSEDCL currently connects. This will achieve the same result as HVDS at less than half the cost.  

In addition MSEDCL claims that losses can be reduced through the use of HVDS. Theft is possible by hooking on the lines from a transformer to the pumps. Since there are only 2 farmers on each transformer in HVDS, farmers will have a sense of ownership, thus preventing theft on the lines from their transformer. The only people that can do hooking in the fields are other farmers. If MSEDCL clears the backlog of farmers who have applied for connections, incidence of theft will surely go down. Also, we must consider if the theft is high enough to warrant a technology that raises costs by 2.5 times.

Getting access to a connection has not been a straightforward matter. Several years may go by between a farmer applying and the connection materializing. Lately the government has been frequently changing the application rules. In March 2018, MSEDCL had stopped giving out grid connections and instead insisting on solar pumps for any farmer that wanted a connection. At that time applications since 2015 were pending at various stages. All those farmers whose application was in a stage where they had not received a quotation from MSEDCL and hence had not paid the application fee, their applications were cancelled, and they were asked to apply again. It is not clear how many farmers have not reapplied. Since June 2019, farmers could also opt for HVDS instead of the solar pump. But now the solar pumps option too has been closed since the government has reach its target of 1 lakh solar pumps distribution, and HVDS is not open to farmers where it may cost more than 2.5 lakhs.

There are several issues with solar pumps too. In Vidarbha and Marathwada, where irrigation is required only in certain months of the year, the cost of a solar PV pump can turn out to be greater than the grid-connected pump including energy cost over the lifetime of the pump, thus resulting in unnecessary expenditure of public funds since all of these configurations are subsidized. The goals of using solar pumps can be achieved more effectively by connecting large solar PV power plants to the grid and supplying daytime power to farmers. In the rest of the world, solar pumps are promoted for use in remote areas where the grid does not exist and where diesel is being used.
Coming to farmers who already have grid connections, they suffer from low voltages and transformer breakdown. Transformer breakdowns are common in peak season and can take 1 to 2 weeks to repair. If a farmer cannot irrigate his crops when required for more than 4 days, yield can drop by 1/3. This is in addition to the aggravation, inconvenience and expenditures caused by pump failures, and pump stoppage due to low voltage. 

Farmers are not concerned whether they get a HVDS connection or a regular grid connection as long as they get a connection in time, and a service that works. It is unfortunate that they have to face this uncertainty and delays in access to irrigation. 
Increasingly, with uncertain rainfall, access to protective irrigation source and electricity is becoming important even for the small farmer growing rainfed crops. Besides application costs, the delay in getting a connection, and repair and maintenance costs are discouraging factors. To improve efficiency and performance, small famers need guidance in the choice of right equipment, water supply layout and collective solutions.

The government has many schemes such as Jalyukt Shivar, Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Prakalp, various subsidies, and loan waivers to compensate for largely uncontrollable factors such as the weather and the market. The electric grid is a man-made system that in principle, should be completely predictable, and can be easily controlled. That MSEDCL is unable to offer our farmers a regular supply is a great disservice to them, completely hobbling their productive abilities, and also adversely impacting other schemes.
