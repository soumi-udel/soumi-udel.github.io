title: Doing a Master's Degree in the US - Part 1. 

---

<hr>

I am an Indian citizen who did his Chemical Engineering Master’s degree from The Johns Hopkins University (JHU). After that I took a gap year, and then got admitted to a PhD program at the University of Delaware, which I am currently pursuing. In this post I will write what I have learnt about the Master’s degree experience. Part 1 will deal with the CV-building aspects of it. Part 2 will deal with trying to make graduate school an enjoyable experience. 

## Deprioritize Courses

As you advance in degrees, taking courses becomes less important then deploying them in the lab. As an MS student, you want to get good grades if you want to apply for PhD afterwards. But spending so much time on them that you don't do any lab work is not a great idea. Take advantage of the freedom of an MS degree and explore. If you are a biology-heavy person, take a course in solution thermodynamics or interfacial engineering. If you are into catalysis, maybe a computational biology course. Why not? It’s only an MS – it’s a stepping stone. Get some experience.

At JHU, We had to do 8 courses. Rather than do 3/3 over the first two semesters, some students did 4/2. This meant more time to do research in the second semester. Speaking of research...

## Spend as much time in the lab as possible

The point of an MS is research, not courses. More time in lab means you can fail more, which leads to good things. My first project led to negative, un-publishable data. Right then, my research advisor (PI) did not have another fully fleshed out project to give me. But because I had started early, I had time to flounder about and figure out something else to work on.

By 'floundering about' I mean I started working on a couple of different avenues. One became my MS thesis project and led to a publication. A couple of ideas failed. Another became a collaborative effort with a friend and colleague, which led to me being a third author on a different publication. 

Another example I give is a friend of mine, who published a few papers (as I write this, they are still coming out) because he was able to work on multiple successful projects (some were collaborations) during his MS.

## Publications and Conference Proceedings are nice

And for these, you need to spend a lot of time in the lab, a lot of time reading papers, a lot of time trying to understand the state of the field you are in, or you want to be in. A good friend of mine made excellent use of his conferences (I wish I had done that) – he networked with other professors and people from the industry, and he had PhD admits and job offers waiting for him at the end of his MS.

Collaborate with lab members if you can. Think of how your research relates to theirs. Be aware of what people around you are doing. Pay  attention to their presentations.

## Some MS students would not or could not do too much work.

As a self-funded (tuition-paying) MS student, you are free labor. It is no skin off the professor’s back if you do not work, as long as you’re not wasting their resources at great speed. If you don’t want to work, you can do the bare minimum to get a Master's degree (which is not a lot, and easily achieved) and still graduate. Your faculty advisor/ PI will notice, probably judge you, and most likely give you a mediocre letter of recommendation. 

Sometimes, it wasn’t their fault. They went to work for a professor who hadn’t updated his web-page since a couple of decades, who gave them some project which he did not care too much about. These sort of projects were slightly unsatisfying. Like a larger version of course projects. They got their Masters’ degree in the end anyway.

## Don't switch off.

There were times (especially later into my MS) I felt I was doing research completely unrelated to what I had thought I would be doing. This led to feelings of confusion and a ‘switching-off’ – I became unenthusiastic about the conferences and presentations around me. There were moments I thought I was wasting my time, because I did not want to make a career out of the work I was doing during my MS.

Don't switch off. It might be hard if you feel what you're doing is irrelevant, but take comfort that your MS degree research might be very different from your PhD thesis topic or your job. Keep doing the research, keep trying to publish, keep talking to people. This path is the most likely to enable you to develop skills, networks and publish.
