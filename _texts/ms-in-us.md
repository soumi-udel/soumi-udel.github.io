title: Things You Should Know Before Starting a Master's Degree in the US. 

---

<hr>

I am an Indian citizen who did his Chemical Engineering Master’s degree from a The Johns Hopkins University. After that I took a gap year, and then got admitted to a PhD program at the University of Delaware, which I am currently pursuing. This is what I have learnt about the Master’s degree experience.

## Spend as much time in the lab as possible

We had to do 8 courses. Rather than do 3+3 over the first two semesters, some students did 4+2, so they had more time to go to lab. I took this path. It meant I could fail more, which led to good things. My first project led to negative, un-publishable data. My PI right then did not have a second project to give me. But because I had started early, I had time to flounder about and figure out something else to work on.

By 'floundering about' I mean I started working on a few different avenues. One became my MS thesis project and led to a publication. A couple of ideas failed. Another became a collaborative effort with a friend and colleague, which led to me being a third author on a different publication. 

Another example I give is a friend of mine, who published a few papers (as I write this, they are still coming out) because he was able to work on multiple successful projects (some were collaborations) during his MS.

Courses – spend the minimum time needed to get good grades (if you are going to apply for a PhD after). Oh, and stop competing in pointless areas. Discuss and learn to collaborate with your peers, and keep an eye out for smart, cheerful, interesting people – make them your friends. Especially people smarter/ more hard-working/ more cheerful/ more kind than you. By imitating people who were better than me at certain things, I became better than I was before.

## Publications and Conference Proceedings are Nice

And for these, you need to spend a lot of time in the lab, a lot of time reading papers, a lot of time trying to understand the state of the field you are in, or you want to be in. A good friend of mine made excellent use of his conferences (I wish I had done that) – he networked with other professors and people from the industry, and he had PhD admits and job offers waiting for him at the end of his MS.

Collaborate with lab members if you can. Think of how your research relates to theirs. Be aware of what people around you are doing. Pay good attention to their presentations.

## Some MS students would not do too much work.

As a self-funded (tuition-paying) MS student, you’re free labor. It is no skin off the professor’s back if you do not work, as long as you’re not wasting their resources. If you don’t want to work, you can do the bare minimum to get a Master's degree (which is not a lot, and easily achieved) and still graduate. Your faculty advisor/ PI will notice, probably judge you, and not give you a great letter of recommendation. I dunno. Maybe they will. Whatever.

## Some MS Students could not do too much work.

It wasn’t their fault. They went to work for a professor who hadn’t updated his web-page since a couple of decades, who gave them some project which he did not care too much about. These sort of projects were slightly unsatisfying. Like a larger version of course projects. They got their Masters’ degree.

## It's only a Masters' degree.

There were times (especially later into my MS) I felt I was doing research completely unrelated to what I wanted to be doing. This led to feelings of confusion and a ‘switching-off’ – I didn’t care what the conferences and presentations were about because they didn’t interest me, I didn’t want to make a career out of the field I was in, because I thought I was wasting my time with my MS. Don’t be like me. Just forget about the relevance, and carry on. Keep doing the research, keep trying to publish, keep talking to people who are in the field you want to be in. (In the end, it turns out I was wrong – I got skills that led to a PhD admit. The fact that I had done independent research – and published – that too, counted to my admit).

Also, take advantage of the freedom of an MS degree and explore. If you’re a biology-heavy person, take a course in solution thermodynamics or interfacial engineering. If you are into catalysis, take a cellular engineering course. Why not? It’s only an MS – it’s a stepping stone. Get some experience.
